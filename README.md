Hello John!

We have available for immediate assignment a single family home in Ingleside that can be kept as a rental or easily vacated for a fix and flip.

35013 N. Wilson Rd, Ingleside, IL 60041
Price: $57,000
2 Bedroom, 1 Bathroom, 1,000 sq. ft.
Lot Size: 6,250 sq. ft.
Property Taxes: $2,727.29
Rented for $810/month
Estimated Repairs: $2,000 to $25,000
Estimated After Repair Value: $120,000+
Estimated Fix and Flip ROI: 37.5%+

Details: This single family home has been rented by the same tenants for 13 years and is currently at around a 10% cap rate. They are currently on month to month for the flexibility and ease of the new owners. There is no immediate rehab needed outside of sealing the basement and getting a new sump pump (the current one is rented). If flipping the property, updating the kitchen and bath and paint is suggested. This home is in the Grant Community High School district (8/10 GreatSchools rating).

Private showings will be conducted upon request. The deal goes to the first person to sign the purchase agreement and remit $5,000 earnest money. If you are a wholesaler and are interested in marketing this deal, you must obtain our permission first. If you have any questions or interest in moving forward, please do not hesitate to reach out as this one will not last long!
